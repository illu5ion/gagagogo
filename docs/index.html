        <p>Arwell uses the powerful PHP framework Laravel 4 on backend. On the front end, it uses Bootstrap 3 for styling and used jQuery for customization. Arwell template is fully responsive and it uses a completely different, open-source admin template called Charisma, that is suitable for admin tasks.</p>

        <p>Although you can use Arwell with different databases, the de-facto standard on hostings are MySQL, so I supported it by default. If you need to use something different than MySQL (such as PostgreSQL) you can easily do the change via configuration.</p>

        <p>Let me give you a short brief about folder system before you start using Arwell.</p>

        <pre>
            app: This is where the backend logic of Arwell is located.
            app/config: Configuration files are located here.
            bootstrap: Used by Laravel framework.
            vendor: All the backend plugins can be found here.

            assets/home: All the assets of Arwell Template is located here.
            assets/admin: All the assets of Charisma template is located here.
            uploads: Anything uploaded by you will be kept here.
            docs: Documentation of application can be found here.
        </pre>

        <p>Files in the main directory are not important for you. They are configuration files of different tools I used while developing this application and completely harmless.</p>

    <h3 id="application1"><strong>3.1 Let's login</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

    <p>Browse <b>`yourwebsite.com`</b>. Click user icon on the right and click login.</p>

            <img class="center" src="assets/images/login.png" style="width: 600px; height: auto;" alt="Image" />

    <p>Login with the credentials you used previously. Upon logging in, you will be redirected to your admin control panel, which looks like this:</p>

            <img class="center" src="assets/images/admin.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;" alt="Image" />

    <p>Using Arwell's Admin Control Panel is really easy and straightforward. Let me shortly explain the interface and tell you what you can do.</p>

    <p><b>`Back to site homepage`</b> link at the top brings you back to the website. By clicking on <b>`admin`</b> on the top-right side, you can choose to logout, or edit your profile information. By clicking on <b>`Update application`</b> on the top-right side, you can update Arwell to the newer version without any hassle. Navigation menu can be found on the left side and that is where you will be spending majority of your time.</p>
    
    <h3><u>Gag Management</u></h3>
    <p>In this section, you can manage gags on your website. You can delete them, or feature on the sidebar.</p>

    <h3><u>Category Management</u></h3>

    <p>You can create categories in this section. They can be named as `Funny, Cosplay, Girls` etc. Users will add their content into those categories.</p>

    <h3><u>Contact Management</u></h3>

    <p>In this section, you can see messages sent to you by website's <b>`Contact`</b> page. You can decide to reply them or delete their message.</p>

    <h3><u>Page Management</u></h3>

    <p>In this section, you can create your own html pages. Creating a page supports both WYSIWYG editor and HTML. Being able to use HTML will let you design your page however you like.</p>

    <p>For example, you can create pages such as: "License aggrement", "Privacy", "Legal", "About Us" etc. or even a "Gallery". How cool is that?</p>

    <h3><u>User Management</u></h3>

    <p>You can manage your users in this section. You can give someone <b>`Administrator`</b> access or <b>`Ban`</b> them. You can also create users yourself. This is very useful if you disable registration but still need to give someone an account to use the application.</p>

    <h3><u>Comment Management</u></h3>

    <p>In this section, you can <b>`Mass approve`</b> <b>`Approve`</b>, <b>`Disapprove`</b> or <b>`Delete`</b> user's comments. By default, comments will be automatically approved. (You can change this feature on Settings Management)

    <p>If you are short on time, you can use <b>Mass Approve</b> tool. It will <b>`Approve`</b> all comments.

    <p>You can also set <b>Auto-approve</b> setting to <b>`Enabled`</b> on <b>Settings Management</b>, so all comments will automatically be approved upon creation.</p>

    <h3><u>Widget Management</u></h3>

    <h3 id="application2"><strong>3.2 Understanding permissions</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

    <p>There are 4 permission types on Arwell.</p>

    <p><b><u>Guests:</u></b> Guests are visitors of your website. They are not logged in by default, so they can't use features like <b>`Commenting`</b>. They can be <b>`Users`</b> if they decide to register and get an account for themself.</p>

    <p><b><u>Users:</u></b> Users are visitors of your website, but unlike guests, they have an account so they can use features like <b>`Commenting`</b> or <b>`Access their profile page`</b> to set up their profile. <b>`/profile`</b> page is only usable when you are an User.

    <p><b><u>Admins:</u></b> Admins are the managers of your website. They can access <b>`/admin`</b> page and manage the whole website. Admins are also a type of User, so they can use both <b>`/account`</b> and <b>`/admin`</b> pages until they logout. There is always at least one <b>`Admin`</b> on the website.

    <p><b><u>Banned:</u></b> Those guys once was an <b>`User`</b>, but <b>`Admin`</b> decided to ban them (maybe they didn't speak polite enough, who knows) so they can't login anymore. <b>`Admin`</b> can ban or unban people in this admin control panel's <b>`User Settings`</b>.
